            <h1>Why Aquent Gymnasium?</h1>
            <h2>We created Aquent Gymnasium to bridge the skills gap.</h2>

            <p>The skills gap is getting in the way.</p>

            <p>It prevents companies from engaging customers across devices and taking advantage of emerging technologies.</p>

            <p>It also prevents digital, creative, and communications professionals from producing great work, delivering results and advancing their careers.</p>

            <p>Aquent Gymnasium bridges the skills gap by taking what we've learned from our clients and developing free, online courses that teach digital designers and front-end developers today's most in demand skills.</p>
